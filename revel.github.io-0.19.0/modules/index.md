**Modules** are packages that can be plugged into an application. They allow sharing of controllers, views, assets, and 
other code between multiple Revel applications or from third-party sources.

A module should have the [same layout](../manual/organization.html#DefaultLayout) as a Revel application's layout. The "hosting" application will merge it in as follows:

1. Any templates in `module/app/views` will be added to the Template Loader search path
2. Any controllers in `module/app/controllers` will be treated as if they were in your application
3. The assets are made available, via a route action of the form `Static.ServeModule("modulename","public")`
4. Routes can be included in your application with the route line of `module:modulename` - see [routing](routing.html#modules)

Revel comes with some built in modules such as [testing](testing.html) and [jobs](jobs.html).

## Enabling a module

In order to add a module to your app, add a line to [`conf/app.conf`](appconf.html#modules):
{% highlight ini %}
module.mymodulename = go/import/path/to/module
{% endhighlight %}

You can add an ordering method by insert a sortable string in between the
word module and the name of the module like the following. This allows you to specify 
which order the views should be loaded, so your application will always be the first,
then the order of the modules and finally the default views in Revel.
{% highlight ini %}
module.01.mymodulename = go/import/path/to/module
module.02.mymodulename2 = go/import/path/to/module2
{% endhighlight %}

An empty import path disables the module:
{% highlight ini %}
module.mymodulename =
{% endhighlight %}

For example, to enable the [test runner](testing.html) module:
{% highlight ini %}
module.testrunner = github.com/revel/modules/testrunner
{% endhighlight %}

## Routing a module
- See the [modules config](../manual/routing.html#modules) in [`app/routes`](../manual/routing.html)

## Building a module
### Best Practices
It's a good idea to make sure all your views are in their own namespace
so that they will not conflict with other applications that your module is
imported into. If you have a module called Reservation, it would be a good
idea to have your view path look like `app/views/Reservation/Controller/Action.html`
. This means that your controller needs to call `RenderTemplate` 
instead of `Render` so that the correct view path is chosen. 

## Module Initialization
The `revel.RegisterModuleInit(func(*revel.Module))` can be for a module to be called immediately after all the modules
are loaded. The `revel.Module` contained in the callback is the one assigned for that module. This can
be used for a variety of purposes. 

An example of a purpose would be to retrieve the logger initialized for
the module like the following

```go
var moduleLogger logger.MultiLogger

func init() {
	revel.RegisterModuleInit(func(module *revel.Module){
		moduleLogger = module.Log
		moduleLogger.Debug("Assigned Logger")
	})
}

```
The `callback` registered in the `revel.RegisterModuleInit` is called before the `revel.OnAppStart`
functions are.
